I graduated with an M.S.E. and a B.S.E. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania</a> in 2023. I minored in Mathematics and Engineering Entrepreneurship as well. I am grateful to be advised by <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Professor Chris Callison-Burch</a>.</p> <p>I am excited about harnessing foundation models for social good. In particular, I am drawn to the following research directions:</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NLP for Social Good: Quality in Education.</code> How can we use NLP research to tackle social problems? For example, in education, how can we improve studentsâ€™ learning experiences and empower teachers to deliver more effective instruction?</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Evaluating LLMs.</code> How can we establish robust benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs)? How can we design frameworks to evaluate specific tasks or models as a whole?</p> <p>I am currently a software engineer in the Core Search and AI team at Microsoft AI.</p> <p>Mentoring is really important to me. If you are a student interested in doing NLP research, please feel free to reach out to me! I am always happy to talk about research or careers in CS.</p> </body></html>
