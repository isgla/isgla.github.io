I am Hannah Gonzalez [(she/her)](https://pronouns.org/she-her). I am a Ph.D. student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu) advised by [Ben Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/) and [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com).

I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) with an M.S.E. and a B.S.E. in Computer Science in 2023. I minored in Mathematics and Engineering Entrepreneurship as well. I am grateful to my research advisors [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/), [Eleni Miltsakaki](https://www.miltsakaki.com), and [Kostas Daniilidis](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/).

Prior to joining Hopkins, I worked as a Software Engineer at Microsoft. I was part of the [Azure AI Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-search/?ef_id=_k_Cj0KCQjwzt_FBhCEARIsAJGFWVk6KhZJtmiTd7MSK8NqmjQlomVTG763Eicjtu7FCJkJ4pkVbmAtjY4aAjG1EALw_wcB_k_&OCID=AIDcmm5edswduu_SEM__k_Cj0KCQjwzt_FBhCEARIsAJGFWVk6KhZJtmiTd7MSK8NqmjQlomVTG763Eicjtu7FCJkJ4pkVbmAtjY4aAjG1EALw_wcB_k_&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21496728177&gbraid=0AAAAADcJh_t7rT9PkVC110PbrO4zFQ50j&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzt_FBhCEARIsAJGFWVk6KhZJtmiTd7MSK8NqmjQlomVTG763Eicjtu7FCJkJ4pkVbmAtjY4aAjG1EALw_wcB) team, where I incorporated retrieval augmented generation (RAG) scenarios in Enterprise search.

I am excited about harnessing foundation models for social good. In particular, I am drawn to the following research directions:

`NLP for Social Good: Quality in Education.` How can we use NLP research to tackle social problems? For example, in education, how can we improve students' learning experiences and empower teachers to deliver more effective instruction?

Mentoring is really important to me. If you are a student interested in doing NLP research, please feel free to reach out to me! I am always happy to talk about research or careers in CS.
