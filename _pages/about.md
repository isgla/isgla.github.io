I am Hannah Gonzalez [(she/her)](https://pronouns.org/she-her). I graduated with an M.S.E. and a B.S.E. in Computer Science from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) in 2023. I minored in Mathematics and Engineering Entrepreneurship as well. I am grateful to be advised by [Professor Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/).

I am excited about harnessing <strong>foundation models for social good</strong>. In particular, I am drawn to the following research directions:

`NLP for Social Good: Quality in Education.` How can we use NLP research to tackle social problems? For example, in education, how can we improve students' learning experiences and empower teachers to deliver more effective instruction?

`Evaluating LLMs.` How can we establish robust benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs)? How can we design frameworks to evaluate specific tasks or models as a whole?

I am currently a software engineer in the Core Search and AI team at Microsoft AI. 

Mentoring is really important to me. If you are a student interested in doing NLP research, please feel free to reach out to me! I am always happy to talk about research or careers in CS.
